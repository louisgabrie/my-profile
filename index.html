               <h2>Cinema</h2>
    <p>
      Cinema has always been an important part of my life. I studied theater for 12 years at the Cours Florent. I acted in 3 short student films at Femis, one of which was taken to the Berlin Film Festival.

               <h2>Football</h2>
    <p>
             You can't say I'm good at soccer. But I'm passionate about it, I love to watch it and I also like to play with my friends (not them).

               <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
               As for my hobbies, I've loved reading since I was a kid, and I really started reading when I was 7, with the Harry Potter books. So I was more into science fiction, but now I prefer novels. 
I also love video games, and playing them with friends is always a good laugh.
I also love to travel, and my dream destination is South America, especially Peru! I'd love to hike to Machu Picchu.
